# Anchor bot tutorial from dummies

## Risks disclaimer

This tutorial provided instructions on how to get anchor-bot from Romain Lanz to run on a regular window machine.

> ⚠️ Running anchor bot on windows is inherently more risky than running on a linux box as linux is much more stable. I recommend running the anchor bot on a headless linux installation on raspeberry pi or nuc or similar.

YOU ARE RUNNING THE BOT AT YOUR OWN RISK AN I DECLINE EXPLICITELY ANY LOSS THAT MAY ARISE DUE TO THIS TUTORIAL.

## Software requirements

On windows you will need:
1. powershell: It will make using command line on windows much less painfull.
2. npm: The executable environment to run the bot.
3. Station wallet: to create a wallet for your bot.
